# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST** dataset. The system uses a dataset of **60,000** training images and **10,000** testing images. The model is integrated into a **Django web application** to allow for real-time digit classification. The project also includes visualizations of training progress, such as loss and accuracy graphs.

## Key Features:

- **Neural Network Model**: A CNN model for handwritten digit classification built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.
- **Real-Time Classification**: Integration with a **Django web app** for real-time predictions of handwritten digits.
- **Training Visualizations**: Graphical representation of the training process, including loss and accuracy metrics.

## Tech Stack:

- **Machine Learning Libraries**: 
  - **TensorFlow** and **Keras** (for building and training the CNN model)
- **Web Framework**: 
  - **Django** (for deploying the model as a web application)
- **Data Visualization**: 
  - **Matplotlib** (for visualizing training progress with loss and accuracy graphs)
- **Dataset**: 
  - **MNIST dataset** (for training and testing the model)
- **Programming Language**: 
  - **Python**
